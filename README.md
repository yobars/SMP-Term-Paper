This is a term paper project on the topic "A Comprehensive Analysis of UI/UX Metrics for Banladeshi E-commerce Mobile Applications".

#Abstract
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of UI/UX metrics for optimizing Bangladeshi mobile e-commerce applications, focusing on usability, responsiveness, visual aesthetics, and user engagement. We move beyond traditional clickthrough and conversion rate metrics to explore a multi-faceted approach for evaluating and enhancing the user experience.

Bangladeshi e-commerce is skyrocketing, with Daraz, Chaldal, Bikroy, and Rokomari leading a wave of user growth that’s reshaping retail and empowering lives. The exponential growth in
E-commerce app users in Bangladesh underscores the burgeoning demand for robust user experience (UX) and app usability within the online business domain. Studies have demonstrated a
strong correlation between positive UX and continued application usage, resulting in increased customer satisfaction. Similarly, app usability has been shown to directly contribute to enhanced user
satisfaction.

#Methodology
A. Survey Design and Distribution
To comprehensively assess the user experience (UX) landscape of Bangladeshi e-commerce mobile applications, we designed a survey that leveraged the established frameworks
of the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) and the System Usability Scale (SUS). This methodical approach ensured a standardized and multifaceted evaluation, enabling a deep dive
into four crucial UX metrics: usability, responsiveness, visual aesthetics, and user engagement.
Participants, constituting a representative sample of Bangladeshi e-commerce users, engaged with meticulously crafted questions aligned with the UEQ’s six sub-scales (perspicuity, dependability, efficiency, stimulation, novelty, and attractiveness) and the SUS’s ten concise statements. This nuanced design yielded not only quantitative data but also unearthed qualitative gems through open-ended inquiries, granting users a platform to voice their unfiltered experiences and aspirations. 

B. Webscraping Google Playstore Reviews
Complementing the insights generated by our meticulously designed survey, the second step of our methodology involved mining another valuable data source: user reviews and rating
scores on the Google Playstore. This endeavor aimed to not only validate the findings of our survey but also to unveil additional aspects and perspectives not captured by closedended questionnaire responses.
Adhering to ethical scraping practices and respecting platform terms of service, we utilized an established library called Google Play Scraper to navigate the Google Playstore ecosystem. Through this process, we meticulously curated a robust dataset encompassing diverse viewpoints, experiences, and sentiments expressed by users, alongside corresponding rating scores providing quantitative signals of overall satisfaction.
By seamlessly bridging the gap between the structured survey data and the unfiltered real-world expressions captured through webscraping, this comprehensive strategy promises a
detailed description of the UX environment in Bangladeshi e-commerce.
