This is a term paper project on the topic "A Comprehensive Analysis of UI/UX Metrics for Banladeshi E-commerce Mobile Applications".

# Abstract
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of UI/UX metrics for optimizing Bangladeshi mobile e-commerce applications, focusing on usability, responsiveness, visual aesthetics, and user engagement. We move beyond traditional clickthrough and conversion rate metrics to explore a multi-faceted approach for evaluating and enhancing the user experience.

Bangladeshi e-commerce is skyrocketing, with Daraz, Chaldal, Bikroy, and Rokomari leading a wave of user growth thatâ€™s reshaping retail and empowering lives. The exponential growth in
E-commerce app users in Bangladesh underscores the burgeoning demand for robust user experience (UX) and app usability within the online business domain. Studies have demonstrated a
strong correlation between positive UX and continued application usage, resulting in increased customer satisfaction. Similarly, app usability has been shown to directly contribute to enhanced user
satisfaction.
